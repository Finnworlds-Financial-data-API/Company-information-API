<h1>Company information API - Finnworlds</h1>

<p><a href="https://finnworlds.com/finance-data/company-information-api/">Company information API</a> made by Finnworlds, offers you a complete database that you can use 
to lookup company details based on their stock ticker symbol, name or ISIN number.
The details you receive in a standard response include ticker symbol, codes, sector, company description, mission, vision, contact and address information, 
leadership details and more. In this way, the API acts as a complete company information database that you can access anytime without having to collect your 
own data and maintain your own database. You will have a complete, actual and detailed company info database right at your hand.</p>
